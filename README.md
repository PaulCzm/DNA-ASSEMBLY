# DNA ASSEMBLY
 This repository addresses the challenge of reconstructing full DNA sequences from short reads generated during sequencing. Using evolutionary algorithms and Hamiltonian paths, the code optimizes the assembly process to produce accurate and plausible DNA sequences. Developed for researchers in genomics, it combines computational efficiency with biological relevance.
