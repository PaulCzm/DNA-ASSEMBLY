# DNA ASSEMBLY
## DNA Sequence Reconstruction Using Computational Methods

## Overview
DNA sequencing generates short reads due to technological limitations, making it necessary to use computational methodologies to reconstruct the complete sequenced DNA. This repository presents a codebase specifically developed to address this challenge, employing evolutionary algorithms and Hamiltonian paths to optimize the reconstruction process and generate more plausible DNA sequences.
